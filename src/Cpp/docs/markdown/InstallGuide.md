# CMake Install Step Guide {#InstallGuide}

## Prerequisites

This tutorial requires knowledge of topics covered in the CMake tutorial on the main page. 
If you have not yet completed that tutorial at least once, go through it before continuing here. 

## Intro

When you generate a CMake project, CMake will populate the build directory with all the files necessary to build the project using the selected build system. Since each build system uses a different file structure, the placement and creation of all content in the build directory is our of our control (we do copy some files into build directories for testing purposes). For example, [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) uses a different directory structure than a [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019) project.

 With this in mind, how do we get useful output from building our program if we don't know the output directory? The solution: [CMake's Installation Step](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/install.html).

Instead of using the build directory folders as our project's "output" we use CMake's install command to build the project then create and organize an output folder so it's ready to be distributed without any need for manually copying or moving files. In this tutorial we'll walk through the process for installing HumanFactors from projects generated by the Cmake-Gui and installing directly from the project folder itself using Visual Studio.

## The Install Step

Depending on what type of project you have, follow either the Open Folder Project or CMake GUI sections.

### Open Folder Project

*Figure* **1.1**: *Solution Explorer for a Visual Studio Open Folder project*

Open Folder means you're operating directly on the CMake directory itself using Visual Studio instead of using the cmake-gui to generate a Visual Studio Project. 

#### Set Install Directory And Settings

In an open folder project, the default install directory is `out/install`. If you are fine with the default directory, then you can move onto the next section.

![CMake Settings json](img/installguide/cmake_settings_json.png)

*Figure* **1.2**: *Highlighted: CMake Settings json file*

If you would like to install to another directory, then Double click on `CMakesettings.json` in the root of your project to open the CMake settings window.

![Solution explorer Advanced Settings](img/installguide/advanced_settings.png)

*Figure* **1.3**: *Highlighted and Circled: Show Advanced Settings*

Scroll to the bottom then click on *Show Advanced Settings* to expand the advanced settings.

![Install directory](img/installguide/install_directory.png)

*Figure* **1.4**:  *Highlighted: Install directory textbox*

First under advanced settings, make sure that your options under the Value column match the ones in *Figure* **1.4** before continuing. After you've verified this is true, enter the path you want to use in Install Directory or click the button to the right of the textbox to select it from a file explorer menu.

***Save your changes by pressing Ctrl + S*** then close the `CMakesettings.json` window. Now we will install the project.

#### Build/Install

![Install HumanFactors](img/installguide/install_humanfactors.png)

*Figure* **1.5**: *Circled: Install submenu*

In the toolbar at the top of your screen left click on the Build button then left click the *Install humanfactors* option. Visual studio will now automatically build and install the CMake project.

*Figure* **1.6**: *Output of running the install step on a debug with no modifications to the install path.*

The contents of your project should now be built and installed to the location you specified in the install section. If you left the default, then it will be installed to `out/install/x64-Debug` for the debug build or `out/install/x64-Release` for the Release build

#### Verifying Output

![Contents of the bin directory](img/installguide/install_directory_bin.png)

*Figure* **1.7**: Contents of the `bin` directory. This should be identical no matter which project type you used.

To verify that the install step was completed successfully, open the `bin` folder in the directory you've installed the project to.  The contents of the bin directory should match those shown in *Figure 1.7*.  If this is true, then you've successfully performed the install step for HumanFactors. If the contents don't match,  make sure that your settings for the project you used exactly match those stated in the tutorial then try again.

### CMake GUI

![Solution Explorer for the CMake GUI](img/installguide/cmake_gui_solution_explorer.png)

*Figure* **2.1**: *cmake-gui project output with INSTALL target highlighted*

This assumes you've already generated the Visual Studio project with the CMake GUI using the guide from the mainpage. Your solution explorer should look similar to that shown in *Figure 2.1*, however you have more or less targets depending on the settings you generated the project with. Right now the only target that is relevant is the INSTALL target.

#### Set Install Directory And Settings

![CMake Install prefix](img/installguide/install_prefix.png)

*Figure* **2.2**: *Highlighted: CMake Install Prefix*

The generated project's install directory is set by the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable in the CMake GUI. You can modify this by double clicking on the path and entering the path to the folder you want to use as output. For this tutorial we'll  install the project into a new folder in our Documents folder. *Ensure that your settings for the options in the HumanFactors group match those specified in this CMake project.* If you've already generated a project, you will need to regenerate the project it by pressing the *Generate* button as shown in the mainpage tutorial.

#### Build/Install

![Build Button](img/installguide/build_button_circled.png)

*Figure* **2.3**: *Circled: Build button for the install target.*

To install using a project generated with the cmake-gui: Right Click on the INSTALL target, then click the *Build* option.

![Installed Project Output](img/installguide/humanfactors_install_dir.png)

*Figure* **2.4**: *Output of running the install step on a debug with no modifications to the install path.*

Just like in open folder walkthrough, the contents of your project should now be built and installed to the location you specified as the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.

#### Verifying Output

![Contents of the bin directory](img/installguide/install_directory_bin.png)

*Figure* **2.5**: Contents of the `bin` directory. This should be identical no matter which project type you used.

To verify that the install step was completed successfully, open the `bin` folder in the directory you've installed the project to.  The contents of the bin directory should match those shown in *Figure 2.5*.  If this is true, then you've successfully performed the install step for HumanFactors. If the contents don't match,  make sure that your settings for the project you used exactly match those stated in the tutorial then try again.
