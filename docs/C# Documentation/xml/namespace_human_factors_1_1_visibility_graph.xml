<para>A Visibility Graph is a graph of points of space locations that have a clear line of sight to each other. Edges in a Visibility Graph are bidirectional, since if one node can see another node, the inverse is true. Generating a Visibility Graph from a set of nodes consists of performing a line of sight check between each combination of nodes, and creating an edge if the line of sight check passes. In this implementation, the cost of every edge in the visibility graph is equal to the distance between the parent and child nodes.</para>
