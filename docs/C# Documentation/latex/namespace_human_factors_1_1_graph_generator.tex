\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Generate a graph of accessible space from a given start point. 

The Graph Generator maps out \char`\"{}accessible\char`\"{} space on a model from a given starting point. In graphs created by this algorithm, node represents a point in space that a human can occupy, and each edge between nodes indicates that a human can traverse from one node to another node. The Graph Generator is a powerful tool for analyzing space, since the graph or nodes it outputs can be used as input to all the analysis methods offered by \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}, allowing for it to be the starting point of other analysis methods within \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
All arguments are in meters for distances and degrees for angles unless otherwise specified. For all calculations, the Graph Generator assumes geometry is Z-\/\+Up i.\+e. upstep is how high the step is in the z-\/direction, ground checks are performed in the -\/z direction etc.
