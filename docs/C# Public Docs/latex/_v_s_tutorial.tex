\hypertarget{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md50}{}\doxysection{Intro}\label{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md50}
In this tutorial we will cover the process of creating a new Visual Studio project that references the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}} C\# interface. We will also walk through the steps of adding non-\/C\# dependencies such as {\ttfamily Human\+Factors.\+dll} to your project, as this is required for the produced program to run at all. After this tutorial is completed you should have a project that is able to reference \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}\textquotesingle{} C\# interface and automatically copy it and its dependencies to the output folder when the project is built.\hypertarget{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md51}{}\doxysubsection{Prerequisites}\label{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md51}
Ensure that you have the following prerequisites before continuing.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The latest copy of the C\# Human Factors Release
\item A copy of Visual Studio. Version should not matter, but for this tutorial I will be using Visual\+Studio 2019
\item The necessary prerequisites for developing C\# projects in Visual Studio. ~\newline

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{1.\+2}}\+: {\itshape Create A New Project Menu}

Upon clicking Create A New Project you should see the create a new project dialog line in . Note that the menu options shown here may be different than yours depending on what Visual Studio extensions you have installed. We want to create a new C\# Library, so we want to filter these options to only include options for C\#. Click on the {\ttfamily All Languages} drop down, then select {\ttfamily C\#} as shown in Figure 1.\+2.

Once you\textquotesingle{}ve clicked C\# the menu should be filtered to only contain C\# project types. Just as before, your list may not exactly match the one shown here depending on the Visual Studio extensions you have installed. The one we\textquotesingle{}re looking for is the {\bfseries{Class Library (.Net Framework)}} circled in Figure 1.\+3. If you do not see this option, scroll up or down to find it. Click {\bfseries{Class Library (.Net Framework)}} to create the project.

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{1.\+4}}\+: {\itshape Con\+Figure Dialog}

In the con\+Figure dialog, you\textquotesingle{}re able to change the name, location and framework version of your assembly. For this demonstration we\textquotesingle{}ll be using the version of the .net framework that Human\+Factors\+C\+Sharp was built with, {\bfseries{Framework version 4.\+5}}. Change the framework version to 4.\+5 by using the dropdown menu circled in cyan in Figure 1.\+4. We\textquotesingle{}ll be leaving the rest of the options as their defaults for this example, but feel free to change the name and location of the project. Once you\textquotesingle{}re ready, click the Create button circled in red at the bottom right corner of the dialog to create the project.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{1.\+5}}\+: {\itshape Blank Project}

After pressing create, Visual Studio display a window for your new blank project. Now we\textquotesingle{}re ready to move on to adding the D\+LL.\hypertarget{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md53}{}\doxysection{Adding A Reference To Human Factors}\label{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md53}
Before we move on to writing the example program, we must first add \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}} C\# D\+LL as a reference.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{right_click_class_library.png}%Add Reference Menu 
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{2.\+1}}\+: {\itshape Menu to add a reference}

In the {\itshape Solution Explorer} on the right hand side of the window, right click on the item with the name of your current solution, hover over the Add option, then click Reference as shown in Figure 2.\+1.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{add_reference_dialog.png}%Add Reference dialog 
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{2.\+2}}\+: {\itshape Add Reference Dialog}

A new window should open similar to the one shown in Figure 2.\+2, however the contents of the window will differ depending on what other C\# projects you have previously built with Visual Studio, or D\+L\+Ls you\textquotesingle{}ve previously added references to in the past. Click the Browse button circled in red in Figure 2.\+2 at the bottom right corner of the dialog. This should open a file explorer window.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{bin_of_humanfactors.png}%Navigate to Human\+Factors D\+LL
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{2.\+3}}\+: {\itshape Human Factors Bin Folder}

In the file explorer, navigate to the bin directory in which you\textquotesingle{}ve installed Human Factors. Select all the files in the bin directory, then click the add button at the bottom right of the window to add them to the menu.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{references_added.png}%References Added

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{2.\+4}}\+: {\itshape References added to the solution, indicated by a checkbox}

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{references_added.png}%References Added
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

If you completed the last step successfully, then you should be able to see all of the added D\+L\+LS checked off in the Reference Manager like in Figure 2.\+4. From this list, only some of the items are C\# D\+L\+Ls, so only leave the deselect every one of the references except for {\ttfamily Human\+Factors\+C\+Sharp.\+dll}, {\ttfamily System.\+Memory.\+dll}, {\ttfamily System.\+Runtime.\+Compiler\+Services.\+Unsafe.\+dll}, and {\ttfamily System.\+Buffers.\+dll}.

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{2.\+5}}\+: {\itshape Only required references checked off}

Once you\textquotesingle{}ve unchecked the unneeded references, you can finish the process of add these references to the project by clicking the add button at the bottom right of the reference manager window. This will close the window and bring you back to your blank project.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{references_tab_circled.png}%References Dropdown Circled
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{2.\+6}}\+: {\itshape References Tab Circled}

For additional verification that this worked, click the dropdown arrow in the solution explorer next to References, circled in red in Figure 2.\+6.

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{2.\+7}}\+: {\itshape New References in dropdown.}

Upon clicking this drop down, all of the references to this project will be displayed. In this list you should be able to see the references we added earlier. These references are highlighted in Figure 2.\+7. If you can see these references in the list, then you have completed this step correctly, and are ready to move onto the next step of this tutorial.\hypertarget{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md54}{}\doxysection{Adding Native Dependencies}\label{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md54}
We added the C\# components of human factors to the project as libraries, however we also need to ensure that those D\+L\+Ls that we unchecked are part of our project as well. While these libraries can\textquotesingle{}t be loaded as dependencies like C\# libraries can, they can still be managed by our project, and most importantly copied to the correct directories when the project is built. If the native libraries are not placed alongside the C\# library, then \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}} will not run once the project is built.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{add_existing_item.png}%Add Existing Item
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{3.\+1}}\+: {\itshape Add Existing Item in Dropdown}

To add a file to your project, right click on the project in the solution explorer window, then hover over add and click {\itshape Existing Item} as shown in Figure 3.\+1.

Upon clicking on the Add existing item option another file explorer window will open. Navigate back to the bin directory of humanfactors.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{all_files.png}%All Files
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{3.\+2}}\+: {\itshape Circled\+: All Files option}

Upon reaching the folder you may notice the folder is now empty. like in Figure 3.\+2 This is because by default, Visual Studio only displays visual C\# files in this dialog. To see other file types, you must click the drop down at the bottom right of the window above the Add button and select {\ttfamily All Files ($\ast$.$\ast$)} circled in red.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{non_csharp_depends.png}%Non Csharp Depends
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{3.\+3}}\+: {\itshape Highlighted\+: Native D\+L\+Ls to add to the project}

This should disable the default filetype filter and allow you to see the D\+L\+LS like in Figure 3.\+3. Highlight all of the native D\+L\+LS that we didn\textquotesingle{}t leave checked off in the previous section. These are highlighted in Figure 3.\+2. Once these are selected, press the {\ttfamily Add} button at the bottom right of the window to add them to the project.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{sltn_explorer_deps.png}%Solution Explorer Files
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{3.\+4}}\+: {\itshape Highlighted\+: Native D\+L\+LS}

After the file explorer closes, go to the solution explorer and scroll down until you see the newly added D\+L\+LS highlighted in Figure 3.\+4.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{sltn_explorer_deps.png}%Native Dependencies in the project
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{3.\+5}}\+: {\itshape Highlighted\+: Native D\+L\+LS in the project}

Select all of these D\+L\+LS and right click on them then click Properties circled in red in Figure 3.\+5. This may not have an immediately visible effect, like in the case of my Visual Studio configuration here. If you, like me, have the properties pane, resize it by dragging it\textquotesingle{}s border upwards. The position of this pane will differ between versions of Visual Studio and personal preferences.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{properties_pane.png}%Solution Explorer Files
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{3.\+6}}\+: {\itshape Properties Pane}

Once the properties pane is visible (outlined in cyan in Figure 3.\+6) click on the item that says {\ttfamily Do not copy}, circled in red in the properties window.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{copy_if_newer.png}%Changing Do not copy to Copy If Newer
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{3.\+7}}\+: {\itshape Changing Do Not Copy to Copy If Newer}

Once you click on {\ttfamily Do Not Copy} you should see a drop down appear to the right. Click on the downward arrow to expand it then select {\ttfamily Copy If Newer} like in Figure 3.\+7. Upon clicking this the option should also change to {\ttfamily Copy if Newer}. Now upon building the program, these files should be copied to the output directory alongside your library and all of the C\# references.\hypertarget{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md55}{}\doxysection{Ensuring Files are Properly Placed in the Output Directory}\label{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md55}
With everything set up correctly, we should now be able to demonstrate that this process works. The goal is to ensure Visual Studio can see the referenced C\# code, and that it copies all of the dependencies to the output directory once the project is built.

under the line {\ttfamily using System.\+Threading.\+Tasks} enter the following using declarations.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{using HumanFactors;}
\DoxyCodeLine{using Humanfactors.SpatialStructures;}
\end{DoxyCode}


Then in the body of the default class {\ttfamily Class 1} Enter the following line.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Graph G = new Graph();}
\end{DoxyCode}


 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{graph_code.png}%Build Solution
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+1}}\+: {\itshape Added Example Code}

Once you\textquotesingle{}ve done this your code should look like Figure 4.\+1

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{build_solution.png}%Build Solution
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+2}}\+: {\itshape Building the project}

After verifying that your code matches Figure 4.\+1, In the top bar of Visual Studio click Build and then click Build Solution. This will compile the C\# code we have written into a D\+LL and put it in the output directory alongside all of the required dependencies. We will now navigate to the output folder to ensure this is true.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{open_in_file_explorer.png}%Open in File\+Explorer
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+3}} \+: {\itshape Open in file explorer}

Right click on your project in the solution explorer, and click open in File Explorer.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{solution_in_file_explorer.png}%Solution in File\+Explorer
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+4}} \+: {\itshape Solution in file explorer}

This should open an instance of the file explorer at the root of your project like in Figure 4.\+4. From here, navigate into the {\ttfamily bin} then {\ttfamily Debug} folders.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{bin_debug.png}%Contents of the debug folder
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+5}} \+: {\itshape Contents of the Debug Folder}

Once there, you should be looking at the output of your program. Verify that all of the C\# and non-\/C\# D\+L\+Ls that we\textquotesingle{}ve added have been copied over successfully. Now that this is the case, we\textquotesingle{}re ready to move onto testing that this D\+LL works.\hypertarget{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md56}{}\doxysection{Testing the Interface}\label{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md56}
To demonstrate this D\+LL is functional, we will attempt to load the mesh data of an obj file from disk. In this tutorial I will be using a simple plane titled {\ttfamily plane.\+obj} however, this should work with any O\+BJ file so pick one of your own that you\textquotesingle{}d like to use with \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}.\hypertarget{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md57}{}\doxysubsection{Create a Console Project}\label{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md57}
Since we created a C\# library, we cannot run it in order to produce output. In order to test our library, we will create a second project that links with our library to execute some of its code.

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{5.\+1.\+2}} \+: {\itshape New Project Dialog}

Like in the previous time we used this dialog, the contents of your new project screen may not match this tutorial\textquotesingle{}s due to differences in what Visual Studio extensions you have installed. Scroll down until you see {\ttfamily Console app (.N\+ET Framework)}, circled in red in Figure 5.\+1.\+2. Click on this option, then click on the Next button in the bottom right, circled in cyan in Figure 5.\+1.\+2.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{5.\+1.\+4}} \+: {\itshape Blank console project}

After that is complete, you should be brought back to Visual Studio with the new console project in your solution explorer (highlighted in 5.\+1.\+4). IF this is the case then we\textquotesingle{}re ready to move onto writing to code to load an obj file.\hypertarget{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md58}{}\doxysubsection{Writing Sample Code}\label{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md58}
Now that we have a console project that we can execute, we\textquotesingle{}ll go back to our library and write the code necessary to load an obj file.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{blank_console_project.png}%Blank console project

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{5.\+2.\+1}} \+: {\itshape Blank console project}

Go back to the .cs file we made in the previous section and double click on it to open it. In this fill we will modify Class1 to be static, then give it a function titled {\ttfamily Sample\+Load\+O\+B\+J()}.

Before moving further, add the lines {\ttfamily using \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors_1_1_geometry}{Human\+Factors.\+Geometry}};} and {\ttfamily using System.\+Diagnostics;} to your block of using declarations. After adding that line, add the word {\ttfamily static} after the word {\ttfamily public} on line 12. This will make it so we don\textquotesingle{}t need to instantiate a new instance of the class in order to run the function we want. After doing this, the editor will show an error with the code we wrote previously. Delete the body of that function, leaving the space between the open and closing braces of Class1 empty.

Once you\textquotesingle{}re sure your code matches, build the project by going to build $>$ build solution. This should build without errors. If this is the case, you have added the sample code successfully and are ready to write the command line application to call it.\hypertarget{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md59}{}\doxysubsection{Adding a reference to the library from the Console App}\label{_v_s_tutorial_autotoc_md59}
In this section we will add the necessary code to the command line application to call the code we just wrote. Despite being in the same solution, we need to explicitly add a reference from Console\+App1 to Class\+Library1 before we can use the code from it.

You should still have the code from Program.\+cs open like in Figure 5.\+4.\+1. From here we\textquotesingle{}re going to add the following line to the {\ttfamily static void Main()} function\+:

{\ttfamily Class\+Library1.\+Class1.\+Sample\+O\+B\+J();}

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{5.\+4.\+2}} \+: {\itshape Default contents of program.\+cs}

After doing this your code should look like this. Once again, build your solution, and ensure that it builds successfully. This is all the code that is required to test this tutorial and we are ready to test it.

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{5.\+4.\+3}} \+: {\itshape Debug Toolbar Circled}

Look at the debug toolbar right of your Visual Studio window, circled in Figure 5.\+4.\+3. You press the {\ttfamily Start} button to debug your program, however the option may default to Class\+Library1 instead of Console\+App1. To solve this, click on the dropdown that says Class\+Library1 and change it to Console\+App1 like in Figure 5.\+4.\+3. There is one more step before we can run the program, and that is to ensure that both Console\+App1 and Class\+Library1 are built as 64 bit applications.

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{5.\+4.\+4}} \+: {\itshape Console\+App1 Properties Menu}

Right click on Console\+App1 in the solution explorer and click Properties, like in Figure 5.\+4.\+4.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{5.\+4.\+5}} \+: {\itshape Console\+App1 Properties Tab}

Now you should be brought to console app 1\textquotesingle{}s properties like in Figure 5.\+4.\+5. Here you can see that the option {\ttfamily Prefer 32 bit} is checked. We want to disable this option by unchecking the checkbox and changing Platform Target to x64.

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{5.\+4.\+6}} \+: {\itshape Console\+App1 Properties Tab}

Once you\textquotesingle{}ve done this, the window should match that of Figure 5.\+4.\+6. Once you\textquotesingle{}re sure of this press {\ttfamily Ctrl + S} to save the changes, then press the X next to the console app 1 tab, circled in red. Ensure there is no asterisk next to the name of the tab before doing this, as that indicates unsaved changes. Once closed this will return you to the program.\+cs window. {\itshape Repeat this process for Class\+Library 1 to ensure that it is also 64 bit before proceeding.}

Now finally, click the start button circled in Figure 5.\+4.\+7 to test the program.

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{5.\+4.\+8}} \+: {\itshape Successful Output Highlighted}

Upon clicking start, you should see a console window appear briefly, then close. Look in the output at the bottom of your Visual Studio window. You should see the line Human\+Factors.\+Geometry.\+Meshinfo. IF this is the case then you have successfully created a project using Humanfactors to load an obj from disk.
