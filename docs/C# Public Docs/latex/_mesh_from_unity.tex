Previous Tutorial\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{_generating_a_graph}{The Graph Generator}}\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysection{Intro}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md28}
In this tutorial we\textquotesingle{}ll be using the project created in the first tutorial\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{_unity_project_setup}{Project Setup}}, and we\textquotesingle{}ll be using concepts and code covered in the previous guides.

In this guide we will cover\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Assigning a game object to a script so it can be referenced by code.
\item Accessing the components of a Game Object
\item Transforming Mesh\+Info instances to Z-\/\+Up
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysection{Scene Setup}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md29}
Up until this point, we haven\textquotesingle{}t needed to interact with the Unity scene, aside from attaching a script to the Main Camera object that is placed by default. For us to demonstrate reading geometry from the scene, we will use the Unity editor to create a plane in the scene that\textquotesingle{}s similar to the plane we previously created in code, but half the size.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{start_point.png}%Blank Scene
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

To begin, open the Unity project from \mbox{\hyperlink{_unity_project_setup}{Unity Project Setup}}.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysubsection{Creating the Plane}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md30}
 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{create_plane.png}%Plane Created
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+1}}\+: {\itshape Creating a plane using the menu bar}

Using the menubar at the top of the screen select Game\+Object $>$ 3D Object $>$ Plane.

Once clicked, a new 10x10 plane will be created at the center of the scene window\textquotesingle{}s view. The plane we created in code was centered on the origin, but this plane isn\textquotesingle{}t since it was created where the scene editor\textquotesingle{}s camera was looking. We must reset this plane to the origin before moving any further.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysubsection{Resetting the Plane\textquotesingle{}s Position}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md31}
 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{look_at_transforms.png}%Transform Visible
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+2}}\+: {\itshape Highlighted\+: The plane\textquotesingle{}s x,y,z position}

Left Click on the newly created plane and look at {\bfseries{Transform}} header in the Inspector located at the right sidebar.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{reset_position.png}%Reset Position
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+3}}\+: {\itshape Resetting the plane\textquotesingle{}s position}

Under {\bfseries{Transform}} you can see the plane\textquotesingle{}s position, rotation and scale within the scene. To set the plane\textquotesingle{}s position to the origin, left on the three dots to the right of the transform header, and select {\itshape Reset Position}.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{resetted_plane.png}%Plane After Reset Position
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+4}}\+: {\itshape The plane centered at the scene origin}

After clicking that button, your plane should be moved to the origin like in Figure 4.\+4. Note that the X, Y, and Z of the plane\textquotesingle{}s position in the Inspector are all set to 0. Ensure that the rest of the variables in the transform header match that of Figure 4.\+4. Now that we have the plane ready to go, we can begin working on the script to get its vertices and triangles.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysection{Writing the Script}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md32}
 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+5}} {\itshape An Empty Script}

Double click on H\+F\+Example\+Script that we created in the first tutorial to open up Visual Studio if it isn\textquotesingle{}t open already. You should see a blank page like the above. If you\textquotesingle{}re coming from a previous tutorial, {\itshape please clear it so it matches this}.

Just like the previous tutorials, we\textquotesingle{}re going to declare which namespaces this script will use in the using section. For now we only need one using declaration. Add this to the top of your script like in the previous tutorials.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{using} \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{HumanFactors}}.\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors_1_1_geometry}{Geometry}};}
\end{DoxyCode}


Later you will be using different sections depending on whether you\textquotesingle{}re generating a graph or firing a ray.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysubsection{Setup for Adding References Through The Unity Inspector}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md33}
 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{plane_in_scene.PNG}%Plane\+Reference
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+6}}\+: {\itshape Script with a Game\+Object property}

There are many ways to reference a Game\+Object in the scene from a script, but for this example we\textquotesingle{}ll be setting up our script so we can select a mesh in the scene from the Unity Inspector. Add a Game\+Object property to the script like shown on line 7 of figure 4.\+6.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{public} GameObject PlaneInScene;}
\end{DoxyCode}


Later we\textquotesingle{}ll use the Unity Inspector to assign the plane in the scene to this property.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysubsection{Getting a Reference to the Mesh Held by a Specific Game\+Object}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md34}
Before we can extract the triangles and vertices from one an instance of a Unity Mesh, we first need to get a reference to the Mesh itself. Doing this requires some understanding of Unity Game\+Objects and their components.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysubsubsection{Background on Game\+Objects and Components}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md35}
 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{plane_inspector.PNG}%Plane\+Reference
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+7}}\+: {\itshape Components of the Plane shown in the Unity Inspector}

Minimize Visual Studio then switch back to Unity for a moment. Left click on the plane we created previously, then look at the Inspector on the right sidebar. It should look similar to Figure 4.\+7. Here you can view all information about the plane, such as its position, the material it uses, which mesh it\textquotesingle{}s referencing, etc. You\textquotesingle{}ll notice the inspector is split into several sections\+: Transform, Meshfilter, Mesh Collider, and Mesh\+Renderer. Each of these sections is a separate {\bfseries{Component}} and the object we see in the scene is just a container for those components called a \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Game\+Object}}}}.

As stated in the Unity Documentation\+:

\begin{quote}
{\itshape Game\+Objects are the fundamental objects in Unity that represent characters, props and scenery. They do not accomplish much in themselves, but they act as containers for Components, which implement the real functionality.} \end{quote}


What this means for us is that the plane we see in the scene is not a Mesh, but a Game\+Object that contains a \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MeshFilter.html}{\texttt{ Mesh\+Filter}} that contains a Mesh. You can think of it like Game\+Object $>$ Mesh Filter $>$ Mesh. To obtain the Mesh itself, we must get it from the Mesh\+Filter component of the Plane Game\+Object.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysubsubsection{In Practice}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md36}
A game object\textquotesingle{}s components can be retrieved using the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html}{\texttt{ Get\+Component}} method. Go back to the Visual Studio window. In our script we will store a reference to the plane\textquotesingle{}s mesh filter in a variable named {\ttfamily Plane\+Filter} at the beginning of the script\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Start()} function like so\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{MeshFilter PlaneFilter = PlaneInScene.GetComponent<MeshFilter>();}
\end{DoxyCode}


Then we can access the actual mesh carried by {\ttfamily Plane\+Filter} by calling its .mesh property\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Mesh PlaneMesh = PlaneFilter.mesh;}
\end{DoxyCode}


Now we have the plane as a mesh and are ready to get the required info from it for \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysubsection{Getting the Vertices and Triangles}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md37}
As previously stated, a mesh is comprised of an index and vertex array. To use this mesh in \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}, we need to construct a Mesh\+Info object using these arrays. Fortunately, Unity provides a straightforward way to access the triangle indices of a mesh in a format that we can use for \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}, but unfortunately the vertices only come in an array of Vector3, instead of the array of floats that we need. We will need to write a method to convert this array of Vector3 into an array of floats before we can use it in \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}.

To simplify the process of converting the vertices to a suitable format, we will add a separate method called {\itshape Vector3\+Array\+To\+Float\+Array} that will transform the array of Vector3 into an array of float ready for Human Factors.

On line 9, just above the Start() function, add the following method\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{private} \textcolor{keywordtype}{float}[] Vector3ArrayToFloatArray(Vector3[] vertices)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keywordtype}{float}[] return\_array = \textcolor{keyword}{new} \textcolor{keywordtype}{float}[vertices.Length * 3];}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keywordflow}{for} (\textcolor{keywordtype}{int} i = 0; i < vertices.Length; i++)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \textcolor{keywordtype}{int} os = i * 3;}
\DoxyCodeLine{        return\_array[os] = vertices[i].x;}
\DoxyCodeLine{        return\_array[os + 1] = vertices[i].y;}
\DoxyCodeLine{        return\_array[os + 2] = vertices[i].z;}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keywordflow}{return} return\_array;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{flatten_vertex_array.PNG}%Convert Vector3 Array
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+8}}\+: {\itshape Location for Vector3\+Array\+To\+Float\+Array}

Now we can call this method with the mesh\textquotesingle{}s vertices as input to get an array usable with \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}. Retrieve the indices and vertices from the mesh by calling its {\ttfamily .triangles} and {\ttfamily .vertices} properties, making sure to convert the array of vertices array from an array of Vector3 to an array of floats.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Get Triangle Indexes and Vertices from the Mesh}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{int}[] plane\_indices = PlaneMesh.triangles;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{float}[] plane\_vertices = Vector3ArrayToFloatArray(PlaneMesh.vertices);}
\end{DoxyCode}


After that, the process of constructing an instance of Mesh\+Info is identical to the previous tutorials\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Send to HumanFactors}}
\DoxyCodeLine{MeshInfo PlaneMeshInfo = \textcolor{keyword}{new} MeshInfo(plane\_indices, plane\_vertices);}
\end{DoxyCode}


Before we can continue to using this mesh it\textquotesingle{}s important to cover a significant difference between this mesh and the mesh we\textquotesingle{}ve been creating in our code.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md38}{}\doxysubsection{Transforming the Mesh From Y-\/\+Up to Z-\/\+Up}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md38}
 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{unity_coordinate_system.png}%Unity\+Coords
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
    
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}
\includegraphics[height=\baselineskip,keepaspectratio=true]{rhino_coordinates.PNG}%Rhino\+Coords
\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{4.\+9}}\+: {\itshape Left\+: Unity\textquotesingle{}s coordinate system. Right\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_human_factors}{Human\+Factors}}\textquotesingle{}s Coordinate system}

The Graph Generator expects geometry to be stored as if the Z-\/\+Axis were up as shown in the picture on the right. In Unity however, the Y-\/\+Axis is up, as shown in the left picture, meaning that we\textquotesingle{}ll get inaccurate results if we use the mesh as is. To solve this, {\itshape Mesh\+Info} has a method {\itshape Rotate\+Mesh} that allows it to rotate itself after is has been constructed. Another class in the Geometry namespace titled {\itshape Common\+Rotations} contains the rotation necessary to perform this conversion.

Enter the following code to rotate the plane to the correct orientation\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//Rotate to Z-\/Up}}
\DoxyCodeLine{PlaneMeshInfo.RotateMesh(CommonRotations.Yup\_To\_Zup);}
\end{DoxyCode}


Now that the plane is in the correct orientation, we are ready to move on to verifying that we loaded the mesh successfully.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md39}{}\doxysubsection{Choose code From Previous Tutorial to Verify Results}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md39}

{\itshape {\bfseries{Raytracer}}} \+: {\ttfamily (1,0,0)}

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries{N\+O\+TE}}\+: For the raytracer you might get an extremely low number for the Z component such as 5.\+960464E-\/08 instead of 0. This is normal, since none of the plane\textquotesingle{}s vertices are exactly at whole numbers like they were in our example script. In fact, if you try to print any Vector3s like the ones returned from Mesh.\+vertices, they will round their components before displaying them. The nodelist returned from the graph will also round the components for every node it contains when converted to a string. Keep this in mind when reviewing results in the future. \end{quote}


If your output matches the above output for the code you\textquotesingle{}ve chosen, then you have successfully completed this tutorial.\hypertarget{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md45}{}\doxysection{Conclusion}\label{_mesh_from_unity_autotoc_md45}
