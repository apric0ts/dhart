This guide will describe how to retrieve the contents of this repository, and build Analysis from source.

\doxysubsection*{Please note\+: Analysis is currently designed to run on a PC~\newline
 running the Windows 10 operating system.}

Also note\+: This guide is a \textquotesingle{}work-\/in-\/progress\textquotesingle{} and subject to change.

\doxysubsection*{Pre-\/requisites}

{\bfseries{Git for Windows\+:}}~\newline
 If you do not already have Git for Windows on your machine,~\newline
 please download and install Git for Windows at \href{https://gitforwindows.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://gitforwindows.\+org/}}

{\bfseries{Microsoft Visual Studio 2019\+:}}~\newline
 \href{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/}{\texttt{ https\+://visualstudio.\+microsoft.\+com/downloads/}}~\newline
 You may use the Community edition.

{\bfseries{C\+Make (Windows win64-\/x64)}}~\newline
 \href{https://cmake.org/download/}{\texttt{ https\+://cmake.\+org/download/}}

Once the software above is installed on your machine, you may continue with the following\+:

\doxysubsubsection*{0. Using Git Bash}

Open {\bfseries{Git Bash}}. Git Bash (M\+I\+N\+G\+W64) begins at {\ttfamily $\sim$}, your home directory.~\newline
 You may remain here, or navigate to a directory of your choice.~\newline
 In the next step, you will clone the {\bfseries{Analysis}} repository.

\doxysubsubsection*{1. Cloning the repository}

Type {\ttfamily {\bfseries{git clone \href{mailto:git@git.njit.edu}{\texttt{ git@git.\+njit.\+edu}}\+:A\+D\+A\+P\+T/\+Analysis.\+git}}} at the prompt~\newline
 and hit E\+N\+T\+ER. The Analysis repository will then be cloned to your local machine.

Now that a local copy of the {\bfseries{Analysis}} repository is on your machine,~\newline
 you may build the project with either\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
\item cmake-\/gui (C\+Make\textquotesingle{}s standalone client)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{Building with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019}

\doxysubsubsection*{0. Opening Visual Studio}

Open {\bfseries{Microsoft Visual Studio 2019}}. After seeing the splash/welcome screen,~\newline
 please click the button that reads {\bfseries{Open a local folder}}.

\doxysubsubsection*{1. Opening the Analysis repository}

When the {\bfseries{Browse}} window appears, navigate to the {\ttfamily {\bfseries{Analysis}}} folder~\newline
 (the repository that you had cloned) on your local machine.~\newline
 Then, navigate to {\ttfamily {\bfseries{src}}.}~\newline
 Click the {\bfseries{Select}} folder button to confirm.~\newline


\doxysubsubsection*{2. Revealing the Solution Explorer}

If the {\bfseries{Solution Explorer}} view is not already open, you may open by~\newline
 navigating to {\bfseries{View $>$ Solution Explorer}}, or alternatively,~\newline
 you can also use the {\bfseries{Ctrl + Alt + L}} shortcut to reveal Solution Explorer.~\newline
 Here, you can examine the sources imported by Visual Studio.~\newline


\doxysubsubsection*{3. Choosing a build version}

There are {\bfseries{two}} build versions for {\bfseries{Analysis}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item x64-\/\+Debug~\newline

\item x64-\/\+Release~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

To change between build versions,~\newline
 navigate (move your cursor) over to the top-\/left portion of Visual Studio,~\newline
 and you will see a drop-\/down bar -- {\bfseries{x64-\/\+Debug}} is selected by default.

If you want to build the {\bfseries{x64-\/\+Release}} version of {\bfseries{Analysis}},~\newline
 change the option in the drop-\/down bar to {\bfseries{x64-\/\+Release}}.

\doxysubsubsection*{4. Building the repository}

{\bfseries{We are now ready to build Analysis.}}~\newline
 {\bfseries{C\+Make}} is used to aid in the compilation process.~\newline


To build, navigate to {\bfseries{Build $>$ Build All}},~\newline
 or you may use the {\bfseries{Ctrl + Shift + B}} keyboard shortcut.~\newline


{\bfseries{You have now built the sources for Analysis.}}~\newline
 You can find the build files in {\ttfamily {\bfseries{.\textbackslash{}\+Analysis\textbackslash{}src\textbackslash{}out\textbackslash{}build\textbackslash{}x64-\/Debug}}}

\doxysubsection*{Building with C\+Make\textquotesingle{}s standalone client (cmake-\/gui)}

Please ensure that you have installed\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (you will get the Visual C++ compiler along with it)
\item C\+Make
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also ensure that you have a local copy of the Analysis repository.

\doxysubsubsection*{0. Opening cmake-\/gui}

Open the {\bfseries{C\+Make (cmake-\/gui)}} application. (Hit the Windows key, and type \textquotesingle{}C\+Make\textquotesingle{})

\doxysubsubsection*{1. Browse source...}

Hit the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Browse Source...\textquotesingle{}}} button to the right of the~\newline
 {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Where is the source code\+:\textquotesingle{}}} text field.~\newline


\doxysubsubsection*{2. Selecting the source code directory}

In the window that appears (titled {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Enter Path to Source\textquotesingle{}}}),~\newline
 navigate to the local copy of {\bfseries{Analysis}} on your machine.~\newline
 ~\newline
 Then, navigate to the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}src\textquotesingle{}}} subdirectory. Click {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Select Folder\textquotesingle{}}}. ~\newline
 The {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Where is the source code\textquotesingle{}}} field should read\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily C\+:/\mbox{[}Y\+O\+U\+R\+\_\+\+P\+A\+T\+H\+\_\+\+H\+E\+RE\mbox{]}/\+Analysis/src}

\doxysubsubsection*{3. Browse build...}

Hit the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Browse Build...\textquotesingle{}}} button to the right of the~\newline
 {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Where to build the binaries\+:\textquotesingle{}}} text field.~\newline


\doxysubsubsection*{4. Selecting the build directory}

In the window that appears (titled {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Enter Path to Build\textquotesingle{}}}),~\newline
 navigate to the local copy of {\bfseries{Analysis}} on your machine.~\newline
 ~\newline
 Then, navigate to the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}build\textquotesingle{}}} subdirectory. Click {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Select Folder.\textquotesingle{}}} ~\newline
 The {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Where to build the binaries\textquotesingle{}}} field should read\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily C\+:/\mbox{[}Y\+O\+U\+R\+\_\+\+P\+A\+T\+H\+\_\+\+H\+E\+RE\mbox{]}/\+Analysis/build}

\doxysubsubsection*{5. Confirming your configuration}

Hit the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Configure\textquotesingle{}}} button in the left-\/center area of the cmake-\/gui window.

\doxysubsubsection*{6. Selecting compiler options}

In the dialogue box that appears,~\newline
 for the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Specify the generator for this project\textquotesingle{}}} dropdown box, ensure that {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Visual Studio 16 2019\textquotesingle{}}} is selected.~\newline


Ensure that the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Use default native compilers\textquotesingle{}}} radio button is selected. Do not fill in the remaining text fields.~\newline


Then, click {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Finish\textquotesingle{}}}.

\doxysubsubsection*{7. Building the repository/choosing a build version}

As stated previously, there are {\bfseries{two}} build versions for {\bfseries{Analysis}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item x64-\/\+Debug~\newline

\item x64-\/\+Release~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

C\+Make will build the project.~\newline
 {\bfseries{Note\+: The build will appear to fail at first. }}~\newline
 The remainder of the directions for this step will rectify this,~\newline
 and you will also be able to select your desired build version. ~\newline
~\newline
 In the center of the cmake-\/gui window, you will see~\newline
 a {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Name\textquotesingle{}}} and {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Value\textquotesingle{}}} table, in red highlighting.~\newline


Next to {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+F\+I\+G\+U\+R\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+T\+Y\+P\+ES\textquotesingle{}}}, click the text field~\newline
 that resides underneath the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Value\textquotesingle{}}} column.~\newline


To select the build version,~\newline
 change the selected field to {\bfseries{Debug}}, for the x64-\/\+Debug version,~\newline
 or {\bfseries{Release}}, for the x64-\/\+Release version, whichever is desired.~\newline


Then, click {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Configure\textquotesingle{}}}.

The build files generated by C\+Make will reside in~\newline
 {\bfseries{{\ttfamily C\+:/\mbox{[}Y\+O\+U\+R\+\_\+\+P\+A\+T\+H\+\_\+\+H\+E\+RE\mbox{]}/\+Analysis/build}}}

For a guide on how to obtain the output D\+L\+LS from this project after it has been generated and built, look at the guide on \mbox{\hyperlink{a01476_InstallGuide}{the Cmake Installation Step}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{Documentation}\label{index_autotoc_md13}
Documentation for {\bfseries{Analysis}} can be found in .\textbackslash{}\+Analysis\textbackslash{}docs\textbackslash{}

The codebase is comprised of sources from\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C++ (see .\textbackslash{}\+Analysis\textbackslash{}docs\textbackslash{}C++)
\item C\# (see .\textbackslash{}\+Analysis\textbackslash{}docs\textbackslash{}C\#)
\item Python (see .\textbackslash{}\+Analysis\textbackslash{}docs\textbackslash{}\+Python Docs)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{C++}\label{index_autotoc_md14}
The C++ portion of the codebase uses a subset of the {\bfseries{Boost}} libraries,~\newline
 and the sources are included with this repository.

Because the Boost sources are included with Analysis,~\newline
 (in {\ttfamily Analysis\textbackslash{}src\textbackslash{}external\textbackslash{}boost}),~\newline
 you do {\bfseries{not}} need to download or install Boost to build the repository.

You may read more about Boost at their website\+: \href{https://www.boost.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+boost.\+org/}}
