This guide will describe how to retrieve the contents of this repository, and build Analysis from source.

\doxysubsection*{Please note\+: Analysis is currently designed to run on a PC~\newline
 running the Windows 10 operating system.}

Also note\+: This guide is a \textquotesingle{}work-\/in-\/progress\textquotesingle{} and subject to change.

\doxysubsection*{Pre-\/requisites}

{\bfseries{Git for Windows\+:}}~\newline
 If you do not already have Git for Windows on your machine,~\newline
 please download and install Git for Windows at \href{https://gitforwindows.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://gitforwindows.\+org/}}

{\bfseries{Microsoft Visual Studio 2019\+:}}~\newline
 \href{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/}{\texttt{ https\+://visualstudio.\+microsoft.\+com/downloads/}}~\newline
 You may use the Community edition.

{\bfseries{C\+Make (Windows win64-\/x64) Version 3.\+8 or higher }}~\newline
 \href{https://cmake.org/download/}{\texttt{ https\+://cmake.\+org/download/}}

Once the software above is installed on your machine, you may continue with the following\+:

\doxysubsubsection*{0. Using Git Bash}

Open {\bfseries{Git Bash}}. Git Bash (M\+I\+N\+G\+W64) begins at {\ttfamily $\sim$}, your home directory.~\newline
 You may remain here, or navigate to a directory of your choice.~\newline
 In the next step, you will clone the {\bfseries{Analysis}} repository.

\doxysubsubsection*{1. Cloning the repository}

Type {\ttfamily {\bfseries{git clone \href{mailto:git@git.njit.edu}{\texttt{ git@git.\+njit.\+edu}}\+:A\+D\+A\+P\+T/\+Analysis.\+git}}} at the prompt~\newline
 and hit E\+N\+T\+ER. The Analysis repository will then be cloned to your local machine.

Now that a local copy of the {\bfseries{Analysis}} repository is on your machine,~\newline
 you may build the project with either\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{a01494}{Microsoft Visual Studio 2019}}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{a01493}{cmake-\/gui (C\+Make\textquotesingle{}s standalone client)}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

For a guide on how to obtain the output D\+L\+LS from this project after it has been generated and built, look at the guide on \mbox{\hyperlink{a01498_InstallGuide}{the Cmake Installation Step}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{Documentation}\label{index_autotoc_md13}
Documentation for {\bfseries{Analysis}} can be found in ./\+Analysis/docs/

The codebase is comprised of sources from\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C++ (see ./\+Analysis/docs/\+C++)
\item C\# (see ./\+Analysis/docs/C\#)
\item Python (see ./\+Analysis/docs/\+Python Docs)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{C++}\label{index_autotoc_md14}
The C++ portion of the codebase uses a subset of the {\bfseries{Boost}} libraries,~\newline
 and the sources are included with this repository.

Because the Boost sources are included with Analysis,~\newline
 (in {\ttfamily Analysis/src/external/boost}),~\newline
 you do {\bfseries{not}} need to download or install Boost to build the repository.

You may read more about Boost at their website\+: \href{https://www.boost.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+boost.\+org/}}
