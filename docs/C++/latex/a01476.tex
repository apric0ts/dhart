This tutorial requires knowledge of topics covered in the C\+Make tutorial on the main page. If you have not yet completed that tutorial at least once, go through it before continuing here.\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Intro}\label{a01476_autotoc_md1}
When you generate a C\+Make project, C\+Make will populate the build directory with all the files necessary to build the project using the selected build system. Since each build system uses a different file structure, the placement and creation of all content in the build directory is our of our control (we do copy some files into build directories for testing purposes). For example, \href{https://ninja-build.org/}{\texttt{ Ninja}} uses a different directory structure than a \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019}{\texttt{ Visual Studio}} project.

With this in mind, how do we get useful output from building our program if we don\textquotesingle{}t know the output directory? The solution\+: \href{https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/install.html}{\texttt{ C\+Make\textquotesingle{}s Installation Step}}.

Instead of using the build directory folders as our project\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}output\char`\"{} we use C\+Make\textquotesingle{}s install command to build the project then create and organize an output folder so it\textquotesingle{}s ready to be distributed without any need for manually copying or moving files. In this tutorial we\textquotesingle{}ll walk through the process for installing Human\+Factors from projects generated by the Cmake-\/\+Gui and installing directly from the project folder itself using Visual Studio.\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{The Install Step}\label{a01476_autotoc_md2}
Depending on what type of project you have, follow either the Open Folder Project or C\+Make G\+UI sections.\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{Open Folder Project}\label{a01476_autotoc_md3}

Open Folder means you\textquotesingle{}re operating directly on the C\+Make directory itself using Visual Studio instead of using the cmake-\/gui to generate a Visual Studio Project.\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md4}{}\doxyparagraph{Set Install Directory And Settings}\label{a01476_autotoc_md4}
In an open folder project, the default install directory is {\ttfamily out/install}. If you are fine with the default directory, then you can move onto the next section.

 
\begin{DoxyInlineImage}

\end{DoxyInlineImage}
  

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{1.\+2}}\+: {\itshape Highlighted\+: C\+Make Settings json file}

If you would like to install to another directory, then Double click on {\ttfamily C\+Makesettings.\+json} in the root of your project to open the C\+Make settings window.

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{1.\+4}}\+: {\itshape Highlighted\+: Install directory textbox}

First under advanced settings, make sure that your options under the Value column match the ones in {\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{1.\+4}} before continuing. After you\textquotesingle{}ve verified this is true, enter the path you want to use in Install Directory or click the button to the right of the textbox to select it from a file explorer menu.

{\itshape {\bfseries{Save your changes by pressing Ctrl + S}}} then close the {\ttfamily C\+Makesettings.\+json} window. Now we will install the project.\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md5}{}\doxyparagraph{Build/\+Install}\label{a01476_autotoc_md5}

{\itshape Figure} {\bfseries{1.\+5}}\+: {\itshape Circled\+: Install submenu}

In the toolbar at the top of your screen left click on the Build button then left click the {\itshape Install humanfactors} option. Visual studio will now automatically build and install the C\+Make project.

The contents of your project should now be built and installed to the location you specified in the install section. If you left the default, then it will be installed to {\ttfamily out/install/x64-\/\+Debug} for the debug build or {\ttfamily out/install/x64-\/\+Release} for the Release build\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md6}{}\doxyparagraph{Verifying Output}\label{a01476_autotoc_md6}

To verify that the install step was completed successfully, open the {\ttfamily bin} folder in the directory you\textquotesingle{}ve installed the project to. The contents of the bin directory should match those shown in {\itshape Figure 1.\+7}. If this is true, then you\textquotesingle{}ve successfully performed the install step for Human\+Factors. If the contents don\textquotesingle{}t match, make sure that your settings for the project you used exactly match those stated in the tutorial then try again.\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{C\+Make G\+UI}\label{a01476_autotoc_md7}

This assumes you\textquotesingle{}ve already generated the Visual Studio project with the C\+Make G\+UI using the guide from the mainpage. Your solution explorer should look similar to that shown in {\itshape Figure 2.\+1}, however you have more or less targets depending on the settings you generated the project with. Right now the only target that is relevant is the I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+LL target.\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md8}{}\doxyparagraph{Set Install Directory And Settings}\label{a01476_autotoc_md8}

The generated project\textquotesingle{}s install directory is set by the {\ttfamily C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+F\+IX} variable in the C\+Make G\+UI. You can modify this by double clicking on the path and entering the path to the folder you want to use as output. For this tutorial we\textquotesingle{}ll install the project into a new folder in our Documents folder. {\itshape Ensure that your settings for the options in the Human\+Factors group match those specified in this C\+Make project.} If you\textquotesingle{}ve already generated a project, you will need to regenerate the project it by pressing the {\itshape Generate} button as shown in the mainpage tutorial.\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md9}{}\doxyparagraph{Build/\+Install}\label{a01476_autotoc_md9}

Just like in open folder walkthrough, the contents of your project should now be built and installed to the location you specified as the {\ttfamily C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+F\+IX}.\hypertarget{a01476_autotoc_md10}{}\doxyparagraph{Verifying Output}\label{a01476_autotoc_md10}

To verify that the install step was completed successfully, open the {\ttfamily bin} folder in the directory you\textquotesingle{}ve installed the project to. The contents of the bin directory should match those shown in {\itshape Figure 2.\+5}. If this is true, then you\textquotesingle{}ve successfully performed the install step for Human\+Factors. If the contents don\textquotesingle{}t match, make sure that your settings for the project you used exactly match those stated in the tutorial then try again.
